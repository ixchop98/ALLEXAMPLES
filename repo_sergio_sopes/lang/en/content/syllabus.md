# Syllabus - Operating Systems 1 - Course - USAC

## COURSE INFORMATION
Operating Systems 1 course helps students to understand operating systems in a practical and easy way, focusing in the operating systems point of study of extended machine and process management. In this way we cover different classic theory to build operating systems or develop distribute systems that match the emerging requiriments of the tech industry. In the same way the student is exposed to new open source technologies like the container, orchestrator and a DevOps mindset.

## GENERAL OBJECTIVE
Understand the structure of the operating system using the point of study view of Extend Machine and Management process to apply that knowledge, to tune up build operating systems, and create solutions that take advange of concurrency and parallel processing.


## SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
- Understand and apply virtualization and cloud computing to build solutions.
- Apply learned processes theory for monitoring servers and do intelligent process management
- Develop systems using concurrency and parallelism to solve real high concurrency problems, like a social network.
- Evaluate different open source technologies to build high availability systems that support high concurrency levels.
- Develop systems implementing containers, orchestrators and some level of observability to simulate the new requirements of tech industry.
